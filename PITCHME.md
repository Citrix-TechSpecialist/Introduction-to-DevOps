### Changes in Data Center Operations
  
  * Current State
  * Future State


+++?image=images/agenda/operations.png&size=contain

+++

## Current State

**Traditional methodologies are characterized by a sequential series of steps:**

  * Requirement Definition (Decide)
  * Planning (Design)
  * Building (Develop)
  * Testing (QA)
  * Deployment

+++

## Current State

**Traditional Teams are fragmented and divided:**

  * Multiple Development Teams
  * Multiple Operation and Infrastructure Teams

+++

## Future State

**To expidite code to delivery, companies have to become lean and agile.**

  * Consolidate multiple operational teams
  * Segment out multiple development teams as independent units
  * Package code to deploy independent of underlying infrastructure
  * Automate application lifecycles with automation tools -- not ad-hoc scripts
  * Streamline deployments and focus more on development
